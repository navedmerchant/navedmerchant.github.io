                    Vibe coding has emerged as a recent trend where Programmers dont really write code. Isntead they tell AI let loose and tell it to 
                    build something they want. AI ofc follows your instructions and builds something. At first it is amazimg. A few things go through your mind
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wow, this is amazing. I can build this so fast.</li>
                        <li>Damn it figured out this too (useForwardRef)? It took a while for me to figure it out the first time I did it.</li>
                        <li>The UI is so cool. I can build anything I want.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    You keep on building more and more. You are in the zone. You arent thinking. You are just coding. About 2 hours later, you look at your 
                    code and you have no clue what you just did. Its like looking at a new repository. The code is Alien to you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then come the bugs. On this button isnt doing what it is supposed to do. Oh why isnt this navigation param making it to the page. 
                    You tell the AI to fix it. 
                    It tries something, it cant fix it. 
                    You tell it to try again. 
                    It tries again, it still cant fix it. 
                    You change the model being used to try and see if that fixes it. 
                    That doesnt work either. 

                    You are not a Slave to the AI. You spend hours debugging it, and you find the issue and fix it. 

                    Something else breaks.

                    You hate Vibe coding. Leaves you with a sour taste in your mouth.

                    You go online, Developers posting on X they just single shotted an entire game. 
                    You keep wondering why you had a different experience. Are they lying? or are is AI just not good at what you were trying to make?

                    You turn off your laptop, and go to sleep. Maybe vibe coding just isnt for you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We need to have a discussion about what "AI" is. At the end of the day its just a function that produces Strings.
                    We have trained this function to output meaningful strings, and in our case, code. 
                    The training of that function has gotten so good, that in some cases it can one shot an entire game.

                    But we forget that its a non deterministic function. And it was trained on buggy code. It can give you a different output every time you call it.
                    Like rolling a dice, the function might produce a token that will take you down to the path of doom.
                    Which is why if you vibe code an entire application, eventually it will mess things up.
                </p>


                <p>
                   AI has given programmers superpowers. You can now write code faster than ever before. We can create great things faster than ever before.
                   There has never been a more exciting time to be a programmer.
                   But just like in X-Men when kids come the school of Gifted youngsters, intitially they have trouble controlling their powers. 
                   With training and experience, they learn to control their powers and use them to create amazing things.
                </p>


                <p>
                    I would like to discuss a real example of this I encountered while building <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mydeviceai/id6736578281">MyDeviceAI</a>. 
                    MyDeviceAI was wirtten mostly using Zen Vibe Coding (More on that later). But this one time, I decided to let lose. 
                    The performance of the App drawer was a little choppy. I just told Claude 3.7, The performace of the App drawer is a little choppy, please fix it.
                    
                    And it did! I was elated, code was checked in, and I released it to testflight.

                    but then I noticed, My phones was getting really really hot when i opened the app. I was worried its going to explode.
                    My mind started wondering, I updated the dependencies, did that introduce a bug thats causing the phone to heat up?
                    I connected xcode profiler, 100% CPU usage!

                    Moreover, it had 100 percent cpu usage even when I wasnt doing anything. The app was just open.

                    Tried different profiling tools to figure out what was the code block causing the 100% cpu usage, no luck. It showed a jumbled up function name.

                    I decided to do a binary search on my commits to find the commit that introduced the bug.

                    It was the dumbest thing AI had written during the optimization vibe coding session.

                    <pre><code>
                        useEffect(() => {
                            function()
                        }, [function]);
                    </code></pre>
                    For people who dont know react, this is the equivalent of an infinite loop in React.

                    Vibe coding can melt your phone!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Vibe Coding is awesome. When used correctly. Its like a superpower that can make you a 10 developer
                    
                    You need to be able to control your superpowers. I call this Zen Vibe Coding.

                    Why Zen? because instead of letting it run wild, you need to calm it down.

                    The overarching rule to remember is that you are the one coding. AI is your assistant.
                    
                    Here is how you can do it:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Work in small sections:
                            Dont just tell the AI to build the feature, Tell it what you want it to build.

                            For example, if you want to add database support to your app. break it down this way.
                            1. Tell the AI to create database helper functions using your choice of library. (for example use op-sqlite)
                            2. Tell AI to generate the functionality and tables next
                            Finally tell the AI to integrate your database with the rest of the app (break this into smaller sections for example add persistence for chats, and then for messages in the chats).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Review the code:
                            Review the code AI has generated. Just like you would review the code of a new developer in your team.
                            Make sure it isnt doing anything crazy
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Commit your code:
                            Commit your code after every small section. This way you can always revert to a working state.
                            If something goes wrong, you can always revert to the previous commit.
                            This is probably the most important thing to do, and a good practice in general, but it becomes even more important when you are using AI.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Dont use Claude 3.7 Sonnet
                            Use Claude 3.6 Sonnet if you are using Claude for coding. Claude 3.7 is a overzealous and tries to do things you dont need.
                            3.6 was an extremely lucky roll, and I dont know how, but its still the best coding model today. It does exactly what you ask it to do nothing more and nothing less and does it perfectly.
                            I hope Antropic doesnt take it away.
                            I dont have enough experience with Claude 4 to have any conculsions on it at this time. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Revert often
                            If you are an experienced developer, you will get the vibe that this isnt heading in the right direction. You will feel like the AI is being overzelous and doing things that arent really needed.
                            In that case, revert and start again. Your prompts are not perfect in their first try and so the code being generated is not perfect. Since you already have the last change commited,
                            its a no brainer to revert and start again. Generating code again is easy, debugging later is a pain.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>


                <p>
                    I have been using this method for a while now, and it has worked wonders. I am writing very little code, and I am mostly using AI to write it using Zen Vibe Coding.
                    Stop vibe coding, start Zen Vibe Coding.
